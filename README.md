# Mapping_Earthquakes

Through the use of Leaflet and Mapbox, API calls are made to populate GeoJSON data and github links to tectonic plate and earthquake data. 

The final map is rendered with overlays of 3 data sets. Those data sets are Tectonic plates/ fault lines, Earthquakes, and Major Earthquakes. All layers populate the map upon launch.

Three map options have been added and can be selected by the user utilizing a dropdown menu. The default map layer is set to Streets.

Markers have been linked to magnitude to display a darker color at a higher magnitude, shown through the legend, and a popup layer has been added so that each earthquake displays magnitude and location of the epicenter.

Programs used: VS Code, Mapbox, Leaflet, Live Server.
